GeometryAlive
=============

"Geometry Alive!" is supposed to be a free online tool for students at schools and universities. In its current state it allows you to discover the world of geometry by directly manipulating with three basic objects: Point, Line and Circle. You can create, select, delete, copy, paste, move and hide these geometrical figures. All this can be done either by manually drawing using your mouse and clicking onscreen buttons or by editing (e.g. by copy/pasting) the special script panel located at the bottom of the application window.
